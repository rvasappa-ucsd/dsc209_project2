# DSC209 Project 2: Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization

## Project Overview
This project explores the ethical boundaries between persuasive and deceptive visualization by creating two opposing visualizations from the same CCRB (Civilian Complaint Review Board) dataset about NYPD misconduct complaints.

## Proposition
**"NYPD accountability has significantly improved since 2010, with substantiation rates of civilian complaints rising from 17.5% to over 30%"**

## Files in This Repository

### Main Deliverables
- **`project2_report.html`** - Main report webpage with both visualizations, design rationale, and reflection
- **`visualization_for.html`** - Interactive Plotly visualization arguing FOR the proposition
- **`visualization_against.html`** - Interactive Plotly visualization arguing AGAINST the proposition

### Data and Scripts
- **`CCRB-Complaint-Data_202007271729/`** - Directory containing the raw CCRB allegations dataset
- **`analyze_data.py`** - Python script for initial data exploration and statistics
- **`create_visualizations.py`** - Python script that generates both interactive visualizations
- **`yearly_stats.json`** - Processed yearly statistics (generated by analyze_data.py)

## Key Design Techniques

### FOR Visualization (Persuasive/Deceptive)
1. **Truncated Y-axis** (starts at 15%, not 0%) - Exaggerates visual impact
2. **Cherry-picked timeframe** (2010-2019 only) - Hides historical volatility
3. **Area fill with green color** - Psychological association with success
4. **Polynomial trend line** - Suggests continuous improvement
5. **Aspirational language** - "Rising Accountability," "Major Improvement"

### AGAINST Visualization (More Earnest)
1. **Full y-axis scale** (0-40%) - Shows true proportions
2. **Extended time range** (2000-2019) - Reveals historical context
3. **Stacked bars** - Emphasizes raw numbers and scale
4. **Strategic annotation** - Highlights 2017 drop
5. **Skeptical framing** - "The Accountability Illusion"

## How to View

### Local Viewing
1. Open `project2_report.html` in a web browser
2. The visualizations are embedded as iframes and fully interactive
3. Hover over data points for detailed information
4. Click "Open in new tab" links to view visualizations separately

### Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No server required - all files work locally
- Internet connection needed only for loading Plotly.js library

## Data Source
NYC Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) - Complaint Data through July 2020
- Dataset contains 33,358 allegations from 1985-2020
- Includes officer and complainant demographics, allegation types, and board dispositions

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x** - Data analysis and visualization generation
- **Pandas** - Data processing and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Plotly** - Interactive visualization library
- **HTML/CSS** - Report webpage

## Deceptiveness Scoring
Each design decision is scored on a scale from -2 to +2:
- **-2**: Fully deceptive
- **-1**: Mostly deceptive
- **0**: Neutral (or unable to decide)
- **+1**: Mostly earnest
- **+2**: Fully earnest

## Key Insights from Reflection
- **Intentional detectability**: Deceptive techniques calibrated to be discoverable by careful reviewers
- **No neutral visualization**: Every design choice is inherently rhetorical
- **Ethical visualization**: Requires transparent argumentation and defensible choices
- **Persuasion vs. deception**: Distinction lies in discoverability and defensibility

## Deployment
This project is deployed on GitHub Pages and publicly accessible at:

**üåê Live Project URL:** https://rvasappa-ucsd.github.io/dsc209_project2/

The site automatically redirects to the main project report with interactive visualizations.

## Notes
- 2020 data excluded from analysis (incomplete)
- Substantiation rate = allegations where board found misconduct / total allegations
- All design decisions intentionally documented for educational/analytical purposes
